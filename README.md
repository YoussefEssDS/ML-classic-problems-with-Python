# ML-classic-problems-with-Python

Working on most known machine learning problems. 

I will Precisely cover:

#### 1-SPAM filter. (Using Sckitlearn I will implement a Naive Bayes model to classify emails).

#### 2-Prediction of candidates to invite for job interviews. 
Using Decision trees / Random Forests algorithms, we will implement a tool that uses historic data to predict wither to invite a candidate for a job interview or not based on skills and some demographic traits of the person such as: experience, gender,disability, and index if the candidate belongs to an under-represented minority.

See the following link for further info about the dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/vingkan/strategeion-resume-skills/downloads/strategeion-resume-skills.zip/2 

#### 3-Prediction of credit card defaulting clients: 
Using SVM (Support vector machines algorithm), we will implement a tool that uses data from defaulting clients in Taiwan between April & September 2005 as a training dataset to predict if a new client is likely to default in the following month, based on their demographic traits and financial situation.
