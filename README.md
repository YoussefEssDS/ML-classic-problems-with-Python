# ML-classic-problems-with-Python

Working on most known machine learning problems. 

I will Precisely cover:

#### 1-SPAM filter. (Using Sckitlearn I will implement a Naive Bayes model to classify emails).

#### 2-Client segmentation. (Using K-means clustering algorithm we will implement a tool for client segmentation).
