# ML-classic-problems-with-Python

Working on most known machine learning problems. 

I will Precisely cover:

#### 1-SPAM filter. (Using Sckitlearn I will implement a Naive Bayes model to classify emails).

#### 2-Prediction of candidates to invite for interviews. 
Using Decision trees / Random Forests algorithms, we will implement a tool that uses historic data to predict wither to invite a candidate for a job interview or not based on skills and some demographic traits of the person such as: experience, gender,disability, and index if the candidate belongs to an under-represented minority.
